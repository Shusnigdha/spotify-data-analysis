>
> ---
>
> ## 📌 Project Overview
>
> This project focuses on analyzing Spotify streaming data to uncover insights related to track performance, artist popularity, platform usage, licensing impact, and audio feature characteristics.
>
> The analysis was performed using **SQL (PostgreSQL)** for data querying and transformation, and **Power BI** for interactive dashboard visualization.
>
> The goal of this project is to evaluate streaming performance metrics, understand engagement patterns, and enable data-driven music analytics insights.

> - Removed inconsistent duration values  
>
> ---
>
> ### 📈 Performance & Engagement Analysis
>
> - Identified Top 10 tracks by streams  
> - Ranked Top 10 artists by total streams  
> - Calculated average engagement per artist  
> - Compared Licensed vs Unlicensed performance  
> - Analyzed streaming contribution by platform  
>
> ---
>
> ### 🎶 Audio Feature Analysis
>
> - Computed average danceability, energy, valence, and acousticness  
> - Identified most energetic tracks  
> - Compared audio features across album types  
> - Visualized feature relationships using scatter plots  
>
> ---
>
> ### 🚀 Advanced SQL Techniques Applied
>
> - Window Functions (Top 3 tracks per artist)  
> - Common Table Expressions (CTEs)  
> - Subqueries for platform comparison  
> - Aggregations and ranking logic
